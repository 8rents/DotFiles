## Platform Branching

Differences in different platforms are save to distinct branches. Currently the branches for different platforms are:

- **debian** - For use with desktop Debian based Linux Platforms (Ubuntu, Mint, etc)
- **debian-server** - For use with Debian based Linux platforms that do not use a desktop (Ubuntu Server, Debian, etc)
- **android** - For use with Android in Termux

Do note that this is the docs branch and there are no dotfiles currently stored on it.

### Other Branches

- blank - A blank branch that other branches are derived from. Only contains a blank README.md template
